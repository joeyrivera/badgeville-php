First instantiate client
    $site = new Site($config);

Now we can go through all objects with chaining if needed
    // get many players
    $players = $site->players()->findAll($params);

    // get a player
    $player = $site->players()->find($id, $params);

    //get a team player
    $player = $site->teams($teamId)->players()->find($id, $params);

    // update player
    $player = $site->players()->find($id, $params);
    $player->name = 'new name';
    $player->save();
        or
    $site->players()->save($player);

    // get many player activities
    $activity = $site->players($playerId)->activities()->findAll($params);

    // get an activity
    $activity = $site->players($playerId)->activities()->find($id, $params);

    // get progresses
    $progresses = $site->players($id)->progresses();
